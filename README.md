# CapSharp

CapSharp is a rewrite of the discord bot `Cap+` in C#.

## Why?

Science isn't about WHY. It's about WHY NOT. Why is so much of our science dangerous? Why not marry safe science if you love it so much. In fact, why not invent a special safety door that won't hit you on the butt on the way out, because you are fired.

## Features

Not much is done yet. If you'd like to help out, please send in a pull request! I'd like if the end user interface looked similar the the one in Cap+, but it's not strictly required.
